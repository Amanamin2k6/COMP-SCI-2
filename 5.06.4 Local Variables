/* All you have to do in this exercise is write a good comment that explains
 * what local variables are. You should also give an example of a function
 * and what the local variables are, and what the scope is of the variable.
 */
/* a local variable is a variable that is stored inside of a function
*and has no identiy outsid eof the function, a scope in a function is
*when you have the same variable name inside a function and outside 
*of it, yet they can have two diferent values because they are both
*stored in different areas.
