1. List at least three particular pieces of data you would collect to determine the effects of water pollution.  What kind of data would you collect (number data, text data, sensor data, etc.)? Would you be able to make any other conclusions by using the data you collect?
    - amount of fish found
    - trash found
    - water measurments



2. Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion. How could you do this in this situation of measuring pollution on a particular river?
    analyizing the results of a combination of test cna give us an accurate understanding of the water polution.
